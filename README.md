* Data Extraction
  * Distributed databases, scrapping, SQL, buying data

* Data Cleaning
  * Missing values and empty data
  * Incorrect types, values
  * Statistical sanitization

* Data Wrangling
  * Hierarchical data, handling categorical data, reshaping and transforming structures, merging, combining and joining data

* Analysis
  * Exploration, building statistical models, visualization and representations, hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, reporting

* Action
  * Building machine learning models, feature engineering, building ETL pipelines, decision making and real-life tests
  * Implementation


## Focus
* Know your goal
* Match methods to your goal
* Focus on usability
* Don't get confused with probabilities
