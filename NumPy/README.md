# NumPy

* Benefits:
  * Faster by using algorithms written in C
  * Fewer loops to keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices
  * Clearer code
  * Better quality

* Installation:
  * Use a local IDE, such a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or [Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com) or an online editor, such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
  * [NumPy website](https://numpy.org/install/)
  * [Matplotlib](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/)
  * Download or use pip
      ```
      $ pip3 install numpy matplotlib



## Projects
#### Numpy with test scores
    '''
    $ import numpy as np


* Creating arrays using numpy.array()
* Treating  complete arrays like individual values to make vectorized calculations more readable
* Using built-in NumPy functions to modify and aggregate the data

* Terms:
  * Vectorization: process of performing the same operation in the same way for each element in an array and removes for loops with the same result.
  * Broadcasting: Process of extending two arrays of different shapes and figuring out how to perform a vectorized calculation between them.
  * Scalar: single number
