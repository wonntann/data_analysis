# NumPy

* Benefits:
  * Faster by using algorithms written in C
  * Fewer loops to keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices
  * Clearer code
  * Better quality

* Installation:
  * Use a local IDE, such as (JupyterLab)[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/], or (Visual Studio Code)[code.visualstudio.com] or an online editor, such as (repl.it)[https://repl.it/] or (Jupyter)[https://jupyter.org/]
  * (NumPy website)[https://numpy.org/install/]
  * (Matplotlib)[https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/]
  * Download or use pip
      ```
      $ pip3 install numpy matplotlib



## Projects
#### Numpy with test scores

* Creating arrays using numpy.array()
* Treating  complete arrays like individual values to make vectorized calculations more readable
* Using built-in NumPy functions to modify and aggregate the data
